## Learning objectives

- [ ] Checkout a new branch using the Git CLI

We need to create **branches** so we can start making changes independently from other branches.
Let's use the Git CLI to do this:

## Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Run the command `git branch --help` and check the description to see what happens when the `--list` option is used with the `git branch` command

2. Now run the command `git branch` and double check your current branch.

3. Run `git switch --create git-cli-workshop` to create a new branch called `git-cli-workshop` and switch to it.

4. Now double check you're on a new branch.
