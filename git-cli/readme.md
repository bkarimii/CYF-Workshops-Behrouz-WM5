## 💡 Purpose

Currently, you're using the 🎮 VSCode **interface** to interact with Git.
However, we can often use different **interfaces** to carry out the same tasks.

In this workshop, you will use the Git CLI - Command Line **Interface** to interact with Git.
In addition, you will:

- Consolidate existing knowledge of Git
- Develop your **mental model** of the working tree and the staging area
- Learn to use basic Git CLI commands


## 📝 Learning objectives

During this session, with the Git CLI, you will:

```objectives
- [ ] Research essential git commands commands for creating a commit
- [ ] Inspect the status of the working directory and staging area
- [ ] Checkout a new branch
- [ ] Add changes from the working tree to the staging area
- [ ] Commit changes from the staging area
```

## 🧰 Setup

Work in pairs:

- Assign one person to be **driver** (the driver will control the keyboard and do the typing)
- Assign another person to be **navigator** (the navigator will read out the questions and explain how to tackle the problems).

The **driver** must ensure they have a clone of this repo on their local machine.
