# Pokedex

This is a staged workshop which can be run over multiple weeks. Trainees will work on their own Pokedex app that displays information about Pokemon. The workshops will focus on different aspects of React, embedding concepts covered in the prep work.

## Requirements

**You need to complete the prep work for this sprint before starting this workshop.** If you haven't done the prep, you've made an error in judgement. You will not be able to participate in this workshop effectively.

The prep is on https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/react.

There is a sample blank React app in the `pokedex` folder for mentors to work with. Trainees should work on their own Pokedex app in their own Module coursework repo. (Probably something like [Username/Module-React](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-React).)
